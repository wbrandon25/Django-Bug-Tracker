DONE: 

comments and tickets they have made 
which projects they have participated in/ are currently working on 

total comments made 

page that shows staff and user directories/listings

crud comments

crud projects 

need update on comments 

user profiles?

marked some issues as resolved 

some parts of forms are already filled out, such as author of a ticket 

create a ticket for the project you are on specificallly 

create search bar that lets you search by title, description, or tag 

restrict all pages 

modify the extender user model in profile page 

etended user automaticallly created when user signs up 

Create custom user model 


people (devs) can have roles so only developres can be assigned to a project - may have to make my own custom form

restrict who can be chosen to be a developer on project 

put the main page into separate segments and put the developers/users on the right 

add another form to the ticket creation process that includes all fields, only for admins 

edit/ delete only if you are the owner 

Create project default select logged in account as user

add date to when comments were made

also use css to make the tables not so long 

add default profile picture

add a my profile button on navbar

in profile, have user info be on the right of image - didnt' do bc does not look nice

fix up profile page

latest bread crumb is not clickable, or not hyperlinked

edit comments shows instance of previous comment

use css to make the search bar not so long and option button to the very right of the screen 

add who made a project, the date, and more info because it be lookiing empty 

flash message when project is updated, created, or deleted 

removing pfp without adding a new one breaks site 

display profile pictures in chat and other places.

User a table for chat because there is less white space between top and bottom of a message? - skipped bc it makes very little difference

fix the numbers not wokring properly in the project/ticket page by making one of them a component so it resets the loop counter? or just use an ul tag? - fixed it by sorting the list before I passed it into the html  

developers can see which tickets have no dev assgined to them - did not implement because the thing below kind of includes it 

^continuing, have a global page that sorts unresolved from resolved and separates assigned and unassigned from the unresolved page 

compact the forms so it is towards the middle of the screen - https://imgur.com/a/zfesCOh - tried using helper with crispy forms but I think it just doesn't work with crispy forms5

limit who can look at options for comments 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->




migrate to sql 

use boot strap + add images 

deploy online - according to video, some changes need to be made 



 <--------------------------------Bit extra----------------------> 

floating block look for forms - not sure how to do this 

 <--------------------------------Too hard for this version----------------------> 

add some kind of graph like the showcase 


 <--------------------------------Remember This Stuff ----------------------> 
Remember when getting the relationship of some model, it EVEERYTHING NEEDS TO BE LOWERCASE, except for first word(maybe) - idk if this is true because some cases it doesn't have to be??? idk man

EXCEPTION IS WHEN USING A MODEL'S BOOLEAN, WHICH HAS TO BE CASE SENSITIVE, OR WHEN YOU USE HTML, IT HAS TO BE CASE SENSITIVE

classes are lowercase but attributes of classes are upper? idk
